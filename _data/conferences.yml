  note: "The AI & Open Government workshop (AIOG) focuses on how modern AI tools and techniques, including Large Language Models (LLMs), can support government accountability and transparency by improving public access to government records and enabling more reliable and compliant disclosure processes. In many jurisdictions, open government and access to information laws such as Freedom of Information (FOIA) and Access to Information (ATI) require large-scale public disclosure of government records, resulting in massive, multimodal data collections whose complexity increasingly challenges both legal compliance and technical processing. At the same time, governments face strict legal obligations to disclose information within statutory deadlines, while protecting sensitive and personal information.  The workshop addresses two key perspectives: (1) AI for citizens--tools and techniques for improving search, exploration, and understanding of public government information;  (2) AI for governments--assisting in accessibility, pre-processing, metadata enrichment, retrieval, filtering, and protecting sensitive information consistent with public disclosure laws"

  note: "No timezone indicated (New York assumed). Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping creativity and innovation in ways that are yet to be fully understood. While Intellectual Property (IP) has long mediated the relationship between law and technological innovation, AI poses new challenges to established legal and regulatory approaches. The complexity and opacity of AI, as well as the pace at which it is being developed and adopted, often leaves legal scholars in a state of contemplative deferral in their analytical and normative evaluations. Against this background, the Leuven IP and AI conference 2026 – following the successful Durham 2025 first edition – aims to bring together national, European and global IP scholars and practitioners to provide a platform for advanced reflection on the latest developments in IP and AI. In particular, the conference aims to examine consolidated as well as innovative solutions to maintain a dynamic balance between rewarding creators and ensuring access to knowledge in the age of AI, and it invites reflections on how evolving IP frameworks can foster sustainable economic, cultural and technological development."

Central to the study of “computer science and law” is the creation of a body of scholarship aimed towards the co-design of law and computing technology to promote social goals. We seek papers that combine rigorous technical computer-science reasoning with rigorous legal analysis to integrate the two disciplines."

Projects using any variety of empirical methods, including experimental methods and qualitative methods, are welcome. Ideal projects for the workshop are in their developmental stages where substantial data collection has not begun. Pilot data collection is, however, appropriate. To ensure substantial individualized feedback, the workshop will be organized around a modest number of developmental projects. Each project will be assigned to an expert commenter and will be allotted 45 minutes of discussion by the attendees. On the second day of the workshop, we will host a discussion of several more developed empirical IP projects by senior empirically-focused scholars.  Since the authors of those papers will serve as the discussants for the workshop papers, we expect workshop authors will remain for the discussion on the second day."
