It brings together a community—scholars, practicing lawyers, and computing professionals—who are fluent both in computational thinking and its rigorous mathematical formalisms and in legal scholarship and thought with its equally rigorous yet human-centric set of principles, methodologies, and goals. Central to the study of “computer science and law” is the creation of a body of scholarship aimed towards the co-design of law and computing technology to promote social goals. We seek papers that combine rigorous technical computer-science reasoning with rigorous legal analysis to integrate the two disciplines."

  note: "No timezone indicated (New York assumed). Focus on free speach (tags for priv., AI, and IP are general). The CALL ---> Are you a law student, judicial law clerk, or lawyer hoping to publish your first, second, or third law review article related to free speech law?  Would you like the opportunity to get advice about your draft from leading free speech scholars? If so, send us your draft by May 15, 2025.  (This should still be a draft article, not an article that’s already published or expected to be published within six months or less.)  We plan to select the submissions that we think are particularly promising, and invite their authors to a workshop—planned for early in the Fall—where they can present their papers and get helpful feedback on them.  We have funds to pay for transportation and lodging for the selected authors’ trips."

The first day of the workshop is intended to give scholars engaging in empirical studies of IP a chance to receive feedback on their work at an early stage in their research. Projects using any variety of empirical methods, including experimental methods and qualitative methods, are welcome. Ideal projects for the workshop are in their developmental stages where substantial data collection has not begun. Pilot data collection is, however, appropriate. To ensure substantial individualized feedback, the workshop will be organized around a modest number of developmental projects. Each project will be assigned to an expert commenter and will be allotted 45 minutes of discussion by the attendees. On the second day of the workshop, we will host a discussion of several more developed empirical IP projects by senior empirically-focused scholars.  Since the authors of those papers will serve as the discussants for the workshop papers, we expect workshop authors will remain for the discussion on the second day."
