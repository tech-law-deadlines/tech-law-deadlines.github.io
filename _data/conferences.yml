With the recent release of DeepSeek and Manus, this race is now increasingly being driven by geopolitical as well as commercial incentives. Yet the potential threat remains."

The first day of the workshop is intended to give scholars engaging in empirical studies of IP a chance to receive feedback on their work at an early stage in their research. Projects using any variety of empirical methods, including experimental methods and qualitative methods, are welcome. Ideal projects for the workshop are in their developmental stages where substantial data collection has not begun. Pilot data collection is, however, appropriate. To ensure substantial individualized feedback, the workshop will be organized around a modest number of developmental projects. Each project will be assigned to an expert commenter and will be allotted 45 minutes of discussion by the attendees. On the second day of the workshop, we will host a discussion of several more developed empirical IP projects by senior empirically-focused scholars.  Since the authors of those papers will serve as the discussants for the workshop papers, we expect workshop authors will remain for the discussion on the second day."
